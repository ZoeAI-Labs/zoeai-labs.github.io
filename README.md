## Support
Most of our customers are based in the US, Europe and the UK. We provide 24x5 support (customer local hours) and have redundant systems in place to minimize outages.

We adhere to SOC 2 Type 1 compliance and ensure that all documents sent across are encrypted and protected. We don't store customer data where possible and use only EU/UK data centers for EU/UK customers using AWS and Azure.

## FAQs
### What are the AI Apps Security and Compliance?
Some of our apps are hosted on Streamlit. Streamlit is hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which provides a secure and compliant infrastructure. GCP’s data centers hold numerous security certifications, including ISO 27001 (information security management) and SOC 1/SOC 2 attestations​. This means the underlying hardware, network, and physical security meet strict industry standards. Streamlit has achieved SOC 2 Type I compliance, which focuses on security and confidentiality controls​. These certifications provide assurance that the service has appropriate safeguards for protecting customer data. 

### What about GDPR complaince?
We are fully GDPR compliant. Here is a our [Data Processing Agreement](GDPR_DPA_Agreement.pdf)  

### What is the difference between the free version and Enterprise version?
We ensure that the look and feel of the Free version is similar to the Enterprise version, so there are no surprises.
The enterprise version differs from the free version in a couple of ways:
* Specific features that you have requested and/or paid for are only available in the Enterprise version.
* The Enterprise Version is in Private App Mode and Invite-only Access. This means that only those with a paid-for email address get access to the Enterprise App.
* Upon cancellation of the AI App Subscription Service, the Enterprise Version of the App is deleted along with the account.

### What happens to uploaded files?
Uploaded files are stored in memory and are not stored or processed as file objects. (More specifically, the data is stored in Python via a BytesIO object, which is stored in RAM). This means it will only persist in RAM until it is overwritten by another session or the container is shutdown.

### Is my data shared with any organisation?
No. ZoeAI Labs does not have access to your data or your documents. See FAQ "What happens to uploaded files". The apps are deployed using Streamlit which are stored in GCP Private Cloud. 

### Is customer data encrypted?
Yes, all data is encrypted in Transit and at Rest. All traffic to and from the AI apps is transmitted securely using HTTPS/TLS encryption. They are served exclusively over TLS (at least v1.2) with strong cipher suites and HSTS enabled. This ensures that any data that is sent to our received by our app (e.g. file uploads, API responses) is encrypted while traversing the internet. When interacting with ours apps you do so over a secure channel, mitigating eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. 
Even though our apps do not persist user-provided data, any residual or temporary files in the container’s filesystem (for example, the source code snapshot) are protected by encryption at rest. Encryption keys are managed by the cloud provider (GCP).

### Do you provide audits?
Yes, these are available for the Enterprise App on request. We maintain records of who has access to the Enterprise app from the customer side. We also maintain a list of who has made changes to the app from ZoeAI Labs, and update this list as roles change, and removing access for anyone who no longer needs it.
